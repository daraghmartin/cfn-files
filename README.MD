# Location of sample files for testing and building composed stacks

Remote repository of files to demonstrate composing nested cfndsl stacks out of distributed and shared remote libraries.

The intention is to build up a stack and use versioning for things like VPCs.  This is to enhance config versioning in Cloudfromation.

The other intention is a test of naive versioning of helping libraries for cfndsl.

Intended to be used with small-librarian (or others) to bring down shared config, libraries, cfndsl.
